try plotting a path (on empty verticies) between a point and one colour of stone.

if you can then it might be part of that colour's territory.

now try drawing a line between that point and the other colour of stone.

if you can then its neutral territory and noone scores it. if you can't then it belongs to the other colour and is scored as theirs
