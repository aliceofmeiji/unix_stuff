# md_to_html

## Markdown to HTML converter in awk, with support for stylesheets

`md_to_html` reads input from `stdin` and writes output to `stdout`.

input is always a markdown file and output is always a html file.

not everything works. == and -- headings are not supported. lists inside lists are not supported. at the moment, you can only have one url per line. and probably many other things.

the stylesheet is defaulted to the file `style.css` in the current directory, but running it with `md_to_html -v style=other_style_sheet.css` sets it to `other_style_sheet.css`.

many many many bugs.
